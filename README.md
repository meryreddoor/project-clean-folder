# Project: Cleaning folders
The purpose of this project is to analyze if the developed countries are suffering less shark attacks year after year.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Relevant information about developed countries:

(“Low Human Development”), with less than 0,55
